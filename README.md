# i3mag

A WIP rewrite of a screen magnification solution for [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) that uses X's panning option.

## Who is this for?

Visually impaired people who'd like to use full screen magnification and the i3 tiling window manager. Don't try to use this for screencasts etc. as it changes your actual screen resolution when activated.
